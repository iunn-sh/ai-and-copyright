###### [Machine Learning Is Not Your Copilot: AI System Accused of Violating Open Source Copyright](https://www.millernash.com/industry-news/machine-learning-is-not-your-copilot-ai-system-accused-of-violating-open-source-copyright-licenses) 2023.01

1. `Digital Millennium Copyright Act`: ingesting and distributing licensed open-source code w/o attribution, copyright notices, and license terms
2. `Lanham Act`: passed off the licensed materials as its own creation, and received unjust enrichment because users paid fees for using Copilot
3. `California Consumer Privacy Act`: unfair competition and privacy
4. `Contract`: violation of licenses governing the use of open-source code for training, interference with contractual relations, and fraud related to GitHub violating its own terms of service

###### [GitHub Copilot copyright case narrowed but not neutered](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/12/github_copilot_copyright_case_narrowed/) 2024.01

- Developers: (1) GitHub violated its terms of service by monetizing user code and that (2) all of the defendants violated the open source licenses attached to the code emitted by Copilot and Codex

> So the plaintiff developers are moving ahead with those claims. They also now have the opportunity to seek monetary damages, and may yet look for a way to revive the unfair competition claim if copyright rules permit.

###### [Does ChatGPT violate New York Times' copyrights?](https://hls.harvard.edu/today/does-chatgpt-violate-new-york-times-copyrights/) 2024.03

- The Times: ChatGPT spits out portions of its articles verbatim or shares key parts of its content, violating copyright law and undercutting its business model. 
- Legal arguments: (1) training = infringement of copyright, (2) LLM = a copy or a derivative work of the Times’ works, and (3) memorization = unauthorized use of copyrighted material.

###### [OpenAI and journalism](https://openai.com/index/openai-and-journalism) 2024.01

1. OpenAI collaborate with news organizations and are creating new opportunities
2. Training is **fair use**, but we provide an **opt-out** because it’s the right thing to do
3. “Regurgitation” is a rare bug that we are working to drive to zero
4. The New York Times is not telling the full story
